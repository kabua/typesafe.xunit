# Contributing to Type Safe xUnit

:blush: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

If you find a bug (or have a question about how to use the library), please open an issue right away. If reporting a bug, please include the version of typesafe.xunit you are using, your runtime platform and version, and a small sample code that can reproduce the problem.

This is a simple project designed to address a simple problem. If you have an idea to improve this project and want to contribute code, the first step is to read the [design guidelines](doc/design.md). If your code meets those requirements, the next step is to raise an issue for discussion. Finally, if the concept has been discussed and appears to be a good fit for Type Safe xUnit, please open a pull request. I know it's slow and inconvenient, but it makes me sad to close PRs that people worked hard on but don't fit in with Type Safe xUnit.

Our code of conduct is simply, be courteous. Seriously, I don't believe we need lawyer jargon. Simply be nice. :blush:

That's all! Thank you once more for your contribution! :+1:
